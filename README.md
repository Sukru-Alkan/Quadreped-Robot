# Quadruped Robot Project 🤖🐾  
This repository contains my **quadruped robot project**, developed as my senior year capstone project. The robot is designed to mimic animal-like walking behaviors using **custom walking algorithms** for stability and movement.  

## Features 🚀  
- **Gait Algorithms:** Implements walking patterns inspired by real quadrupeds.  
- **Microcontroller-Based Control:** Uses **ARDUİNO** for motor control.  
- **Simulation & Testing:** Tested with both physical and simulated environments.  
- **Custom Kinematics & Motion Planning.**  

## Technologies Used 🔧   
- **ARDUİNO** (if applicable, for testing/simulation).  
- **Hardware:** Servo motors, sensors, and microcontroller-based control.
